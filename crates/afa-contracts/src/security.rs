//! Code Map: Security contract surface
//! - `SecurityV1`: The "I am a security engine" badge. The locked
//!   v1 trait every engine implements. See `SecurityV1` below.
//! - `SecretRef`: The opaque receipt a caller gets back from
//!   `seal`. See `SecretRef` below.
//! - `UnsealedSecret`: The zeroing-on-drop handle to a sealed
//!   secret's plaintext, briefly opened. See `UnsealedSecret`
//!   below.
//! - `SecurityErrorV1`: The eleven "what went wrong with security?"
//!   buckets. See `SecurityErrorV1` below.
//! - `SecretSealed` / `SecretUnsealed` / `SecretRotated`: The three
//!   audit facts the engine publishes on the event bus. See the
//!   three structs at the bottom of the file.
//!
//! Story (plain English): Imagine a bank's safe-deposit box desk.
//! You walk in, give the clerk a small box of papers, ask them to
//! label it "tax returns 2025", and walk out with a paper receipt
//! that says "tax returns 2025, box 7". The receipt
//! (`SecretRef`) is small and never says what's inside — it just
//! says where the box is. The box itself is in a vault you can't
//! see. When you come back with the receipt, the clerk disappears
//! for a moment, opens box 7, and hands you the papers
//! (`UnsealedSecret`) so you can read them at the desk. As soon as
//! you walk away from the desk, the papers are shredded — that's
//! the "zeroize on drop" rule, so a passerby can't see them in
//! the trash. If you ask the clerk to open box 7 again next week,
//! they go to the vault and either find it (and you get fresh
//! papers), find it marked "rotated" (you get told "this receipt
//! is from before the box was swapped"), or don't find it at all
//! (you get told "we have no record of this box"). Every time
//! they do anything, they stamp a small line in the audit log
//! (`SecretSealed`, `SecretUnsealed`, or `SecretRotated`) — never
//! with the actual papers, just with the receipt number and the
//! time.
//!
//! This file is just the contract — the dictionary the engine
//! promises to honour. The actual desk clerk and vault are in
//! the `afa-security` crate (a later phase of this pack). The
//! dictionary is the only thing in `afa-contracts`, because the
//! dictionary is small, never does I/O, and is the same for
//! every deployment (a real bank, a crypto wallet plugin, and a
//! test fixture all use exactly the same words).

// (the same pattern `afa-contracts` itself uses for
// `ExampleThingV1`); native `async fn` in traits is not

// Uses: SecretRef, UnsealedSecret, ExecutionContext,
// SecurityErrorV1.
// Used by: the engine implementation in `afa-security` and every

// key, a future webhook plugin for its signing secret, etc.).

// `format!("{}", ref)` would invite `Display` to leak the name
// into a log line in a way the next maintainer didn't expect.
// The name is the human-meaningful label the caller passed to
// `seal`; the version is the integer counter the engine picked.
// Uses: serde, the standard derives.

// the underlying buffer is overwritten with zeros via a volatile

// "dead store"). The `Deref<Target = [u8]>` impl lets a caller
// pass `&handle[..]` to an HTTPS client without copying the
// bytes. It deliberately does NOT implement `Clone` (a clone
// would double the plaintext exposure surface), `Display`, or
